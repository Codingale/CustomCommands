## Requirements

## Installation
To install, simply extract the files from the releases section or download the beta branch by clicking the download ZIP button.

Then extract to your `garrysmod/addons` folder.

So you should now have a folder structure like this:
`<garrysmod>/addons/CustomCommands/lua`
